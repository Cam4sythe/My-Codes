        <p>It's no secret that software development has exploded in the past 20 years. New software startups pop up like dandelions in the spring. It then follows that a lot of people think software development is a good career choice and are afraid of missing out on a lot of great opportunities. Software developers are, in general, pretty opinionated. I doubt this is unique to developers, but it gets tiresome when you've dealt with it for years. If we're not fighting over what operating system is better, then it's what language is better. If it's not that, then it's code editors, or databases, or frameworks, or bug trackers, or development processes, or...or...or. It's like we enjoy fighting. In a time where more and more people are becoming developers, it's not enough to be just "a developer" anymore. No, to feel superior now, developers need to somehow differentiate themselves from both the non-developer “rabble” and their fellow developers. This mentality has lead to more coding languages being developed that purport to "fix" issues with other languages. New frameworks are built to "fix" issues with previous frameworks. And on and on. All this leads to a huge amount of choices, opinions, and resources. Naturally, that makes starting to learn, daunting. Since I'm a developer too, I'm susceptible to the same opinions and biases that I just railed against. The difference is, I'm right. I'm kidding, seriously, calm down everybody. Here are my suggestions.

            <h2>Which Codes To Learn First</h2>
        <!--  <img src="http://4kwallpapers.com/images/walls/thumbs_2t/7.jpg" alt="DATA GONE"/> -->
            <p>Depends on what you want to do.
            Want to be a web dev? HTML/Javascript/CSS
            Want to learn a simple programming language that will work for many things? Python
            Want to become a game developer? C# or C++
            Want to learn a programming language that will be a little painful to learn but will help you a lot and works in embedded systems, Operating Systems, Drivers, and smart electronics? C</p>
        <h2>All Coding Fields</h2>

        <h4>As an example, here's a list of what I can kind of gather:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Developent (front, back, full stack)</li>
          <li>Game Development (mobile, console, desktop)</li>
          <li>InfoSec / Hacking Security (malware, pentesting, network security etc. Tons of cool stuff)</li>
          <li>Reverse Engineering (assembly?)</li>
          <li>Database Development / Big Data / Data Analytics</li>
          <li>Mobile Development (Android / IOS)</li>
          <li>Desktop Application Development (When I think of this, I mostly think of corporate type jobs. Banks etc. Kind of a catch all I guess...)</li>
          <li>Internet of Things Development (smart home solutions)</li>
          <li>Robotics (I know nothing about this field)</li>
          <li>Embedded systems</li>
          <li>Operating systems</li>
          <li>Distributed computing</li>
          <li>Scientific computing</li>
          <li>Multimedia software</li>
          <li>Communications systems</li>
          <li>Digital signal processing</li>
          <li>Digital control systems</li>
          <li>Software development tools</li>
        </ul>
